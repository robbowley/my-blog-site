# 1. Record Architecture Decisions

Date: 2024-03-22

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project to:
- Provide context for future development decisions
- Document the reasoning behind our technical choices
- Help onboard new team members
- Track the evolution of the system architecture

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document significant architectural decisions in the project.

Each ADR will include:
- The context that led to the decision
- The decision itself
- The consequences of the decision
- The current status

## Consequences

- Team members can understand why certain technical choices were made
- Future decisions can be made with better context
- The project's architectural history is preserved
- Changes to previous decisions can be tracked
