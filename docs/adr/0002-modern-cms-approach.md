Proposed

## Context

The current Pragmatic Partners website runs on WordPress, which presents several challenges:

## Decision Points to Consider

### Content Management Options:
1. **Headless CMS**
   - Separates content management from presentation
   - Provides API-first approach
   - Allows for modern frontend frameworks
   - Examples: Strapi, Contentful, Sanity.io

2. **Git-based CMS**
   - Content as code
   - Version control for content
   - Developer-friendly workflow
   - Examples: Netlify CMS, Forestry

3. **Custom CMS with AI Features**

   - Opportunity to showcase AI integration
   - Full control over features
   - Higher development investment

## Consequences
