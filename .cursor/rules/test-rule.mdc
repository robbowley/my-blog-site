# Test Rule

This is a simple test rule to demonstrate how Cursor rules work. Rules help the AI understand the codebase better and provide guidance for development.

## Key Points:
1. Rules are stored in `.cursor/rules` directory
2. Rules use `.mdc` extension
3. Rules can reference files using special syntax: `[filename](mdc:filename)`
4. Rules use Markdown format with Cursor-specific extensions

## Example File Reference
When we want to reference a file, we use this syntax:
- Main file: `[index.html](mdc:index.html)`
- Style file: `[styles.css](mdc:styles.css)`
